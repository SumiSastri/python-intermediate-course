# a = 5 # operators perform a special task between values or 2 variables
# b = 10 # an operand is what the operator operates on
# c = a + b arithmetic operators are +/ -/ */ ** pow/ //division & double division math floor/ % modulus
# d = a + 40
# e = 30 + 70 + 100 # no matter how long the statement is the operators only operate on 2 operands
# #binary operators operate on only 2 operands at all times

# print(5+2); print(5-2); print(5*2);print(5**2);print(5/2);print(5//2);print(5%2);

# concatenation operator + does not print 2 different types, strings are immutable can not convert abc into a number

# print(5 + int('5'))
# print(str(5) + '5')
# print (5 + 5)
# print ('5' + '5')

# replication does not matter the order as they are 2 different types the string is replicated if same type, multiplied
# print ('4' * 5)
# print (5 * '4')
# print (5*4)

# compound assignment operator
# a = 5
# a += 2 (add 2 to a)
# a %= 3 (a now is 7 modulus answer therefore is 1)
# print(a)

#comparison operators only returns true or false

# a = 5
# b = 10
# print (a == b)
# checking as a comparison is a equal to be not an assignment operator
# print (a == b)
# print (a != b)
# print (a > b)
# print (a < b)
# print (a <= b)
# print (a >= b)

#logical operators - and, or, not - as words not symbols

# a = 5
# b = 10
# c = 15
#
# print (a < b and b > c) # both must return true otherwise returns false
# print(a < b or b > c) # either operator can be true or false returns true
# print(not(a > b)) # negates the logic and returns the opposite

# and precendence if there is no not, otherwise not takes precedence, not is a unary operator others are binary

#Membership operators prints a return of true or false in all compound variables - in/ not in
